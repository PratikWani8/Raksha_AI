## ❗ Problem Statement

Women safety is a critical issue in modern society. In emergency
situations, victims may not be able to call for help quickly due to
panic, fear, or lack of access to resources. Traditional systems often
lack real-time tracking, immediate response, and intelligent assistance.

There is a need for a smart, AI-powered system that can provide instant
help, automate complaint generation, and alert authorities with minimal
user interaction.

---

## 💡 Solution Approach

Raksha is designed as a smart web-based safety system that integrates
Artificial Intelligence, Geolocation, and Real-Time Communication to
provide immediate assistance.

The system enables users to send SOS alerts, share live location, find
nearby police stations, and generate complaints automatically. Admins
can monitor SOS alerts in real-time and take quick action.
